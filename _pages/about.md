I was born in Genova in 1995, and I moved to Rome with my family when I was 3 years old. After primary and secondary school I attended scientific high school [Liceo Morgagni](https://www.liceomorgagni.edu.it/) there, obtaining my degree in 2014. I then moved to northen Italy, where I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and my Master Degree in Data Science at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/), respectively in 2018 and 2019. My Bachelor thesis stemmed from my curricular internship at [Enel Italia](https://www.enel.it/), which took place for 5 months in 2017. While attending my Master course, between September 2018 and December 2019, I have been working as a technologist at [Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)](https://www.fbk.eu/en/).
